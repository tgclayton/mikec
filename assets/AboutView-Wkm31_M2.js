",-1),u=e("p",null," The MikeC Sixty-One SRT has an all-tube signal path and produces 15W rms of clean power from a pair of EL84s, 4x preamp tubes and an EZ81 tube rectifier. This amp can be loud, but with the variable power control (labeled “VRM”) it produces awesome “saturated with clarity” tones at much lower volumes. It also includes built-in spring reverb and bias wiggle tremolo that enhance the already rich tone or can be used for more aggressive effects. A simple “TONE” control manages the highs-mids-lows and a “CUT” control provides the fine tuning of the high end. An OFF or ON “Corrective Filter” has been incorporated on the output to remove excessive “sizzle” if this is your preference. And for ease of speaker cab matching, there are dual speaker outputs with the choice of 4, 8 or 16-ohm speaker impedance.
