This progressed to building these amps for others. I played in a rock covers band as a guitarist for 10 years and have experienced a variety of amps including Fender, Marshall, Vox and Dr. Z. I prefer Marshall crunch and edge-of-breakup tones and prefer having reverb and tremolo built into the amp. I am not a fan of solid state, digital or modelling amps even though many of the more recent models sound great. The big issue for me is that they end up in the land fill - within a short period of time they become impossible to repair. Hand built tube amps can be maintained and repaired - just look at the classic amps, many of which are well over 50 years old, sound fantastic and are still in use. I am a qualified electronics technician. ",-1),d=e("p",null," As guitarists we face the issue of getting “that” tone at a reasonable volume. When most of the classic tube amps are in their “sweet spot” they are too loud for the neighbours or the sound guy. I have experimented with lower powered amps, master volume control, low efficiency speakers and a variety of power attenuators which all can be effective. Then I discovered Power Scaling. ",-1),c=e("p",null," Power Scaling is achieved by reducing the B+ high-voltage DC that feeds the tubes. Power Scaling can be applied globally to the entire amplifier or only to the power section. Power Scaling allows you to control the output wattage (loudness) of your amp with the twist of a knob. And when done well it retains the amp’s tonal character even at lower volumes.
