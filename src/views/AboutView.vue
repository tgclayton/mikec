      I’ve been building valve guitar amps for over 10 years to experience the classic amps that I
      simply could not afford. I was inspired to create the Sixty-One SRT (Special Reverb Tremolo)
      after watching Doug and Pat’s review of their awesome sounding Vox AC10 SRT.

      Vox produced very few of these 10-watt heads because they came to life during the era of
      guitarist wanting more powerful amps with greater volume. But today it’s easy to mic a great
      sounding low powered amp.

      The MikeC Sixty-One SRT has an all-tube signal path and produces 15W rms of clean power
      from a pair of EL84s, 4x preamp tubes and an EZ81 tube rectifier. This amp can be loud, but with
      the variable power control (labeled “VRM”) it produces awesome “saturated with clarity” tones
      at much lower volumes. It also includes built-in spring reverb and bias wiggle tremolo that
      enhance the already rich tone or can be used for more aggressive effects. A simple “TONE”
      control manages the highs-mids-lows and a “CUT” control provides the fine tuning of the high
      end. An OFF or ON “Corrective Filter” has been incorporated on the output to remove
      excessive “sizzle” if this is your preference. And for ease of speaker cab matching, there are
      dual speaker outputs with the choice of 4, 8 or 16-ohm speaker impedance.

      This thing nails the “sound in my head” and as an amp builder, not only do I want a great
      sounding amp that people want to experience but it must be professional looking. To these
      ends I have ensured that the Sixty-One SRT schematics/layouts are readily available and the
      drilled chassis, front/rear control panels, turret boards are optionally available to purchase.
